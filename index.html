      <h2> Cultures </h2>

      <h2> Reading books </h2>

     <p> reading books and transporting myslef into another universe is the power of books that I adore. Time stops and you get to travel through it. However, depends on books, if you do not enjoy it, you can say hello to boredom and focus issues.

      <h2>Business and trade offs</h2>

     <p> One of the reasons why I went to ESSEC business school is because I love the international scale of it. The melting pot of cultures and people. I love business and I am aiming to work in that field later after my years of studies, in as many countries as possible. Don't ask me the field, as the majorirty of us, I do not have a single clue.
